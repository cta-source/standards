# CTA-2120, Design Requirements for a Label for IoT Device Cybersecurity

This repo contains file objects referenced in CTA-2120: graphic images and json. For information about these files, see [CTA-2120](https://www.cta.tech/standards/cta-2120/). 

Provided here are black and grey EPS/SVG/PNG versions of sensor icons used in the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark program _(black is used to 
indicate "product has this sensor", grey to indicate "product doesn't have this sensor", see CTA-2120 for details)_. Files are 
provided with multiple resolutions for the PNG versions.  

These icons are not square. 

The following is the approved version of the CTA-2120 schema as of June 18, 2025 (Version 1.0.0). Matches CTA-2120 (June 2025).

The following is a mockup of the intended label rendering for the consumer. It shows the "L1" label rendering on the left (i.e., the "consumer friendly" version 
pointed to by the URL encoded in the product QR code), and the more technical "L2" rendering. This mockup is for reference only.
